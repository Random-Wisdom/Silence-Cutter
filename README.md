# Silence-Cutter
## Automatically remove silent parts of video easily
### My very first practical piece of code 

This small and simple python code lets you automatically remove silent parts from your video, hence saving you a lot of time

The scirpt uses ffmpeg and python.

This idea was inspired from : https://github.com/carykh/jumpcutter 
and                         : https://gitlab.com/dak425/scripts/-/tree/master


This was made on windows and it might not work on other platforms.

1. Install
      * . [Python](https://www.python.org/)
      * . [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/)

2. Add FFMPEG to path
3. Place the python script and the video to be cut in same folder
4. Run the python script and enter **filename.extension**
